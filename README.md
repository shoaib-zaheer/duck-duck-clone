[`End resulte`](https://shoaib-zaheer.github.io/duck-duck-clone/)
****
### Descration:

> By just looking at this project it looks very simple and easy to complete, but after deep diving to this project I realize "I have less knowledge about `CSS`" so mostly I follow the original codes of page developer and did my experiment by changing some codes in middle of every step.
studying a project from DOM or browser (developer tools) was very important step on completing this project.
Making the page menu was very default it took almost all my time to fugger it out, but I find out help from WCschool web page.

### Steps that I follow for this project:

* Studying the DOM of [`DuckDuckGo`](https://duckduckgo.com/).
* Created wireframe on paper first.
* Created wirefare on computer using `Pencil` open sourse Sofetwear.

* Copy and save images from DuckDuckGo web site to my own repository.
* Created/ builded *HTML* `tags`, `classes` & `IDs`.
